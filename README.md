## Step-by-Step Development

### 0. Boilerplate Setup

- Created `README.md`
- `npm init` to initiliaze `package.json`
- Created src folder to have `stringCalculator.js and stringCalculator.test.js`
- `npm install` to have `node_modules`
- `yarn` to have `yarn.lock`
- `yarn add -D jest` to add jest
- `git init` to initiliaze it as git repository.

### 1. First Test Case for `empty string should result in 0`
A. Wrote a failing test case (Red step)
B. Ran npm run test to confirm the test failed.
C. Implemented logic in stringCalculator.js.
D. Re-ran npm test and test passed (Green step).
E. Optional: Refactored code while keeping tests green


### 2. Second Test Case for `single number should result in the number itself`
@Looping (A, B, C, D) steps

### 3. Third Test Case for `two comma-separated numbers should be added`
@Looping (A, B, C, D) steps

### 4. Fourth Test Case for `multiple comma-separated numbers should be added`
@Looping (A, B, C, D) steps

### 5. Fifth Test Case for `comma and newline as delimiters should be handled correctly`
@Looping (A, B, C, D) steps

### 6. Sixth Test Case for `custom delimiter should be supported`
@Looping (A, B, C, D) steps

### 7. Seventh Test Case for `negative number should throw an exception`
@Looping (A, B, C, D, E) steps

### 8. Eigth Test Case for `multiple negative numbers should throw an exception`
@Looping (A, B, C, D) steps

### 9. Ninth Test Case for `numbers greater than 1000 should be ignored`
@Looping (A, B, C, D, E) steps

### 10. Tenth Test Case for `handles custom delimiter of any length enclosed in brackets`
@Looping (A, B, C, D, E) steps

### 11. Last Test Case for `handles multiple custom delimiters like [*] and [%]`
@Looping (A, B, C, D, E) steps
